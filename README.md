## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The following data cleaning steps were performed:
- Handled missing values in numerical and categorical columns using median and mode
- Removed columns with excessive missing data
- Ensured the dataset was suitable for analysis

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to explore relationships and trends within the data using:
- Bar charts for categorical variables
- Histograms for numerical distributions
- Box plots to compare survival trends
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features

Key variables analyzed include:
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Age
- Fare
- Survival Status

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males  
- Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival  
- Children showed a higher survival probability  
- Higher fare values were associated with higher survival rates  

---

## ✅ Conclusion 🏁
This task highlights the importance of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in understanding real-world datasets. Through EDA, meaningful patterns and trends were identified, demonstrating how data-driven insights can be extracted before applying machine learning models.
